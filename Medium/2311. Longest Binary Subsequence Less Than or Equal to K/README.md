# 2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

You are given:
- A **binary string** `s` (only contains `'0'` and `'1'`)
- A **positive integer** `k`

Your task is to return the **length of the longest subsequence** of `s` that forms a binary number **less than or equal to `k`**.

### ðŸ’¡ Notes:
- You can **skip characters** to form the subsequence, but **the order must remain the same**.
- The resulting binary number may contain **leading zeros**.
- The empty string is considered to be `0`.
