# 1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three
Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 
```py
nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
```
### Output:
```py
18
```
### Explanation: 
Pick numbers `3`, `6`, `1` and `8` their sum is `18` (maximum sum divisible by `3`).



## Constraints:

+ `1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 104`
+ `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
