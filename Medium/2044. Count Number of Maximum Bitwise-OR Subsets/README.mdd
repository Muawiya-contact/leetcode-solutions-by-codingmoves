# 2044. Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to:
1. **Find the maximum possible bitwise OR** of any subset of `nums`.
2. **Return the number of non-empty subsets** that produce that maximum OR value.

> A subset is defined by selecting elements (in order or not), and **two subsets are different if the chosen indices differ**, even if the values are the same.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The max OR is 3.
Subsets that give 3: [3], [3,1]
```

# 🚀 Constraints
+ `1 <= nums.length <= 16`

+ `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁵`
