---

## 🧠 Problem Summary

You are given a list of events, where each event is represented as a pair `[startDay, endDay]`.  
Each event can be attended on **any day between `startDay` and `endDay` inclusive**, but you can **only attend one event per day**.

### 🎯 Goal:
Return the **maximum number of events** that can be attended.

events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
```
### Output:
```python
3
```
✔️ Attend each event on a different day: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3.

## ✅ Constraints
  + `1 <= events.length <= 10^5`

  + `events[i].length == 2`

  + `1 <= startDay <= endDay <= 10^5`
