# 1625. Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations

You are given a string s of even length consisting of digits from 0 to 9, and two integers a and b.

You can apply either of the following two operations any number of times and in any order on s:

+ Add a to all odd indices of s (0-indexed). Digits post 9 are cycled back to 0. For example, if s = "3456" and a = 5, s becomes "3951".
+ Rotate s to the right by b positions. For example, if s = "3456" and b = 1, s becomes "6345".
Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on s.
