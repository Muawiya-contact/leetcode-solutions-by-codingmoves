## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

You are given:
- An integer array `nums`
- An integer `value`

You can perform **any number of operations** on the array:  
> In one operation, you can either **add** or **subtract** `value` from any element in `nums`.

The **MEX (Minimum Excluded Number)** of an array is the **smallest non-negative integer not present** in the array.

Return the **maximum possible MEX** after applying the operations any number of times.
