# 3355.Zero Array Transformation I

This project implements an efficient solution to the **Zero Array Transformation I** problem, a medium-level challenge that involves range-based operations on an array.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

You are given:
- An integer array `nums` of length `n`.
- A list of `queries`, where each `query[i] = [li, ri]`.

For each query:
- You can select **any subset of indices** within the range `[li, ri]`.
- Decrease the values at those selected indices by 1.

Your goal is to return `True` if it's possible to turn `nums` into an array of all zeros after applying all the queries in order. Otherwise, return `False`.

## âœ… Example

### Input:
```python
nums = [1, 0, 1]
queries = [[0, 2]]
```
### Output:
```
True
```
### Explanation:
Pick indices 0 and 2 in the query, subtract 1 â†’ [0, 0, 0].

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Works

- `diff` helps in tracking how many times each index is affected by all queries.
- Instead of updating each index in every query (which is slow), we update the **boundaries** and later apply a **running total (`cnt`)**.
- At the end, if any `nums[i] > cnt`, it means we **can't decrement it enough** â†’ return `False`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + q)` where `n = len(nums)` and `q = len(queries)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the difference array
