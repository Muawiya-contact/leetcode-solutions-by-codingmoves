# 2163. Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

You are given a `0-indexed` integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of **exactly** `n` elements from `nums`. The remaining `2 * n` elements will then be split into two equal parts:

- The **first n elements**: their sum is `sumfirst`.
- The **next n elements**: their sum is `sumsecond`.

The goal is to minimize the **difference**:  
`sumfirst - sumsecond`

### Return the **minimum possible difference** after removing any `n` elements.

## ðŸ’¡ Example

### Example 1:

```text
Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: n = 1. Try all 1-element removals:
- Remove 3 â†’ [1,2] â†’ (1) - (2) = -1
- Remove 1 â†’ [3,2] â†’ (3) - (2) = 1
- Remove 2 â†’ [3,1] â†’ (3) - (1) = 2
Minimum = -1
```
