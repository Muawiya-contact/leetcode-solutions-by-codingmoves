# 3640. Trionic Array II

You are given an integer array nums of length n.

A trionic subarray is a contiguous subarray nums[l...r] (with 0 <= l < r < n) for which there exist indices l < p < q < r such that:

nums[l...p] is strictly increasing,
nums[p...q] is strictly decreasing,
nums[q...r] is strictly increasing.
Return the maximum sum of any trionic subarray in nums.
