# ðŸ¥­ 2106. Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

You are on an infinite x-axis and want to collect fruits.  
You're given:

- A sorted list `fruits`, where `fruits[i] = [positionáµ¢, amountáµ¢]`
- An integer `startPos` (your starting position)
- An integer `k` (maximum number of steps you can walk)

You can walk left or right, 1 step per unit. You can walk **at most `k` steps** in total.  
At each fruit position you reach, you **collect all fruits** there.

Your goal is to return the **maximum number of fruits** you can harvest.

```python
fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
```
#### Output:

```
#### Explanation: 
Move to 6 (3 fruits), then to 8 (6 fruits), steps = 3
