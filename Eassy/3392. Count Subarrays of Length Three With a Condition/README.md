# Count Subarrays of Length Three With a Condition

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of subarrays of length 3 such that the sum of the first and third numbers equals exactly half of the second number.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```python
nums = [1, 2, 1, 4, 1]
```
## Output:
```
1
```
### Explanation:

Only the subarray [1, 4, 1] contains exactly 3 elements
where the sum of the first and third numbers equals half the middle number.
# Constraints:
+ 3 <= nums.length <= 100

+ -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

### Installation
To run this solution, you need to have Python installed on your system.
You can execute the script directly using the following command:
