# 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given `head`, a reference node to a singly-linked list where each node contains a binary digit (0 or 1), return the **decimal (base-10) value** of the number that the linked list represents.

The **most significant bit** is at the **head** of the linked list.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Example

```python
Input: head = [1, 0, 1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in binary = 5 in decimal
```
# âœ… Constraints
  + The linked list is not empty.
  
  + The number of nodes will not exceed 30.
  
  + Each nodeâ€™s value is either 0 or 1.
