## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:
#### Input: 
```
arr = [2, 6, 4, 1]
```
##### Output: 
```
false
```
#### Explanation: 
There are no three consecutive odd numbers.

---

## ✅ Constraints

- 1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000  
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000  

---

## 💡 Hint

Use a counter to keep track of the number of consecutive odd numbers. Reset it when you encounter an even number.

## 📈 Time & Space Complexity

- ⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- 🧠 Space Complexity: O(1), since only a counter variable is used.
