# 67. Add Binary



Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 
```py
a = "11", b = "1"
```
### 
```py
Output: "100"
```
## Example 2:

### Input:
```py
 a = "1010", b = "1011"
```
### Output: 
```py
"10101"
```

## Constraints:

+ `1 <= a.length`, `b.length <= 104`
+ `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
+ Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
