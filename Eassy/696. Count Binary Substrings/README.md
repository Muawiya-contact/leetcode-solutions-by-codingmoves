# 696. Count Binary Substrings

## 🧠 Problem Summary

Given a binary string `s` (containing only `'0'` and `'1'`),  
return the number of **non-empty substrings** that:

1. Have the **same number of 0's and 1's**
2. All 0's are grouped together
3. All 1's are grouped together

Substrings that appear multiple times are counted multiple times.
